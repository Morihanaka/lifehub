Information about LIFEHUB v0.1

*LIFEHUB is a WIP name and will likely be changed before release.*

This web application attempts to serve as an aggregation of a user's favorite data management websites. For each user, there are categories relating to different aspects of their life that contains data they like to manage, such as work, health, and finance.

For example, if a user has signed up for data management websites such as Mint (for personal finance), Slack (for work communication), and Fitbit (for fitness and health tracking), they can access links to all of these and more within different categories and a quickstart page on LIFEHUB.

LIFEHUB also contains a handy sidebar that displays information that the user deems important, such as their productivity level, the meetings and appointments they have today, and how close to their fitness goals they are. This information will be displayed in the form of widgets that are sortable and removable.

The user interface is designed to be accessible to all users, and includes functionality for offline mode.
